# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a monitoring system
tailored for the laboratories at the University of Alabama in
Huntsville. This system consists of three main nodes: OWL,
PERCH, and NEST. The PERCH node is responsible for
monitoring temperature, pressure, humidity, and volatile
organic compounds (VOC). The OWL node tracks occupancy
levels by responding to motion of persons entering or exiting
lab. Lastly, the NEST node serves as a central hub, collecting
data from the other nodes and presenting it graphically on a
web server that can be accessed remotely.

# Project Impact
This system can:  
● Aid faculty in analyzing long-term trends and correlating
environmental factors with student engagement to optimize
laboratory usage;  
● Enable students to remotely check any lab’s capacity,
facilitating optimal entry times;  
● Assist lab administrators to ensure correct operation of air
conditioning equipment.  

# Status
● PERCH node sensor integration/development: Completed  
● PERCH node firmware testing: Completed  
● OWL node sensor integrationt: Completed  
● OWL node testing: Completed  
● Database creation on NEST node: Completed  
● Network communication to NEST: Completed  
● NEST webserver UI: In-Progress  
● OWL occupancy detection algorithm: In-Progress  

# Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the guidance and sponsorship that has
been given unto us from our mentor, Dr. Aleksandar Milenkovic, and our
cornerstone design professors, Dr. Emil Jovanov and Dr. Buren E.
Wells.
